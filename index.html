    <h1>About Me</h1>
  
    <p>I am result driven. I like having concrete goals to meet and enough time to figure out a strong strategy for accomplishing them. I am driven by constantly wanting to develop my skills. I enjoy creating an organized schedule for completing tasks and achieving my goals on time.</p>
    <p>I am highly passionate about many forms of art. I have always been a creative person at heart. Photography, painting, and pencil drawings have been my favourites in the past years. However, I have been learning how to use technology to create and develop a different form of art.  Web development in my eyes is a different way to express and develop an artwork. It's having a vision and bringing it to life much like a painting or photography. Web development was by far my favourite part of Computer Application Technology I took as a subject in school.</p>    
    <p>Having grown up in Maun, Botswana and with both of my parents working in the Tourism Industry, I believe I have a unique perspective to dealing with clients and to seeing things a little differently. From what marketing techniques catch people's eye to being able to comfortably socialize with clients.</p> 
    <p>Children and early child development is another one of my interests in life. I’ve always been fascinated by how their little minds work and develop. Working with children has taught me patience and control over my own emotions and actions, and an acute awareness of how I phrase, and approach things and the impact my actions can have on others.</p>
